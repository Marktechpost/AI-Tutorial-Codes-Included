        "# Introducing Deepagents Library by LangChain\n",
        "While a basic Large Language Model (LLM) agent—one that repeatedly calls external tools—is easy to create, these agents often struggle with long and complex tasks because they lack the ability to plan ahead and manage their work over time. They can be considered “shallow” in their execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deepagents library is designed to overcome this limitation by implementing a general architecture inspired by advanced applications like Deep Research and Claude Code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture gives agents more depth by combining four key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **A Planning Tool:** Allows the agent to strategically break down a complex task into manageable steps before acting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Sub-Agents:** Enables the main agent to delegate specialized parts of the task to smaller, focused agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Access to a File System:** Provides persistent memory for saving work-in-progress, notes, and final outputs, allowing the agent to continue where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **A Detailed Prompt:** Gives the agent clear instructions, context, and constraints for its long-term objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "By providing these foundational components, deepagents makes it easier for developers to build powerful, general-purpose agents that can plan, manage state, and execute complex workflows effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this article, we’ll take a look at a practical example to see how DeepAgents actually work in action."

It is noted that the act was meant to protect these stakeholders by ensuring transparency around the use of copyright-protected works by generative AI models, yet their concerns seem to have been overlooked in favor of larger AI model providers ([source](https://publishingperspectives.com/2025/10/jessica-sanger-on-the-eu-ai-act-rights-holders-concerns/)).\\n\\n4. **Ethical Governance and Capability Building**: The EU AI Act includes provisions aimed at enhancing capability and understanding of AI technologies among operators, similar to suggestions of a \"digital driver\\'s license\" for AI, ensuring that users are knowledgeable about the risks and impacts of AI.

The AI used tools like write_file and a task subagent to research the latest updates on the EU AI Act, save the question to question.txt, generate a detailed report, and save it to final_report.md. The final entry shows the AI confirming that the research is complete and provides a link to access the report.

Here are some key updates and global implications based on recent discussions and analyses:\\n\\n1. **Investment and Implementation Strategy**: The European Commission has announced a substantial funding push with an allocation of approximately $1.16 billion. This is part of broader initiatives like Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, aimed at lifting AI adoption from 13.5% of businesses to a target of 75% by 2030. These initiatives emphasize venture-capital flows, training programs, compliance tools, and data interoperability and access, highlighting a commitment to robust AI deployment across the single market ([source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/carvina-capital-on-eu-s-1-16b-ai-push-1035325000)).\\n\\n2. **Comparison with Global Regulations**: In contrast to the EU AI Act, other countries like South Korea have implemented AI regulations targeting developers and service providers rather than users. While South Korea\\'s Basic AI Act is narrower, it signals increasing global compliance costs and the necessity for industries, including telecommunications, to adopt robust risk-management frameworks ([source](https://www.lightreading.com/ai-machine-learning/new-ai-regulations-in-eu-and-south-korea-signal-rising-compliance-costs-for-telcos-omdia)).\\n\\n3. **Rights Holders\\' Concerns**: There has been criticism regarding the implementation of the EU AI Act, particularly concerning the lack of incorporation of feedback from rights holders. It is noted that the act was meant to protect these stakeholders by ensuring transparency around the use of copyright-protected works by generative AI models, yet their concerns seem to have been overlooked in favor of larger AI model providers ([source](https://publishingperspectives.com/2025/10/jessica-sanger-on-the-eu-ai-act-rights-holders-concerns/)).\\n\\n4. **Ethical Governance and Capability Building**: The EU AI Act includes provisions aimed at enhancing capability and understanding of AI technologies among operators, similar to suggestions of a \"digital driver\\'s license\" for AI, ensuring that users are knowledgeable about the risks and impacts of AI. This reflects a broader intention to preserve human agency in the deployment of AI, echoing global conversations about ethical AI governance ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/corneliawalther/2025/10/18/do-we-need-a-digital-drivers-license-for-ai-access/)).\\n\\nThese updates illustrate the EU’s proactive role in shaping global discussions on AI ethics, regulations, and governance, setting a framework that could influence regulations in other regions. The focus on comprehensive training and certification exemplifies Europe\\'s commitment to responsible AI development and deployment.'},\n",
